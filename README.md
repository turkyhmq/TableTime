# TableTime: Restaurant Reservation Application

## 1. Introduction

One of the biggest causes of customer dissatisfaction is the waiting time for food preparation. Restaurants typically address this with reservation systems. However, organizing reservations manually — and even through current apps — has many shortcomings.  
A key issue is the lack of a feature allowing customers to select a specific table, which can result in dissatisfaction and loss of customers.

Our goal is to develop a reservation application that solves these problems by integrating **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies, specifically **Near Field Communication (NFC)**.  
Using NFC, reservations will become more automated, streamlined, and user-friendly. Customers will also be able to select their preferred table for dining, enhancing their overall experience.

We aim to make reservations easier for both customers and restaurants while improving the dining experience and boosting customer satisfaction.

## 2. Problem Statement

Current restaurant reservation services often:

- Require extensive manual input, consuming employees’ time.
- Lack options to prepare meals before the customer's arrival, leading to long wait times.
- Do not allow customers to book specific tables, impacting the dining experience.

Our project addresses these issues by offering an improved, smart reservation system.

Note: to make the app work, you will have to change the IP address for the device aka laptop (during testing on laptop where phone is connected to the laptop) in both 

The path for files where IP address located are the script in XAMPP and Connections folder in the app files
