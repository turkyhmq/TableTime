                                    <strong>Our Mission:</strong> Our mission is to develop a reservation application that not only solves the waiting time problem but also enhances the overall reservation experience for both customers and restaurants. We aim to leverage Internet of Things (IoT) technology, specifically Near Field Communication (NFC) tags, to automate and simplify the reservation process. By integrating NFC tags, we empower customers to choose any table they desire in the restaurant for dining, providing them with a personalized and satisfying experience.
